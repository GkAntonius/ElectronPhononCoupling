Suppose you make a change to the code and it breaks the test.
There may be a good reason for that: for example, you might have
changed some default parameters. If you understand why the tests break,
and you want to overwrite the reference data for the tests,
then just run the package as an executable:

    python -m ElectronPhononCoupling

You might have some explaining to do.
