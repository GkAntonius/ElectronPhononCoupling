In order to create an example, follow these steps:

1)
    Place the Abinit inputs in a subdirectory of Examples/Calculations/
    (including pseudopotentials).

    If this test relied on an external module to produce the Abinit inputs,
    the script that generated them may be included,
    but the calculation must be usable without this script.

2)
    Place the script using EPC in the Examples/
    and make sure that the output files are produced in Examples/Out/.

3)
    Edit the setup.py so that the outputs and data produced by Abinit
    and by EPC are excluded from the MANIFEST.in file.

4)
    Edit the .gitignore file
    that the outputs and data produced by Abinit
    and by EPC are excluded from the git revision.

    to add the output and data files of the calculations 
    to the list of excluded files.
